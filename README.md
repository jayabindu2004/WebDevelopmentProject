<h1> WebDevelopmentProject</h1>
This is my first front-end web development project done as a part of my academics. It is a hostel website that serves as an online platform to showcase their accommodations, services, and amenities to potential guests.<br><br>

<h2>OVERALL VIEW OF THE PROJECT IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION<br>
HOSTEL SERVICES WEB PAGE
</h1></center>
<br>
<h3> OBJECTIVE:</h3>
<p>
  Hostel services web page provides a user friendly interface to access the hostel facilities. The home page consists of information and pictures of the hostel and a login form, where it allows the user to login or if new, it allows the user to register. When login to the home page is done, the user will be directed to the other web page named as menu which offers various options for the user to select according to their need. Each option is linked with their respective web pages which allows the user to enter data and submit. Every web page consists a footer which mentions the contact details of the hostel management and also consist the option to go back and return to the home page which when clicked will redirect to the previous page and home page respectively.
</p>
<br>
<h3> PLAN OF ACTION:</h3><br>
<b>	FORMATTING WEB PAGE LAYOUT USING HTML</b><br>
<p>All the web pages format is designed using HTML. HTML forms, tables, lists, headings, title, paragraphs, images, fieldset, footer, attributes etc are all included in the web pages. The layout of the web page is built in such a way that the user finds it easy to access and use.</p>
<br>
<b> DESIGNING THE WEB PAGE USING CSS</b>
<br>
<p>The web pages are designed using CSS to make it attractive and eye catching to the user. Background colours, background images, font style, font size, font weight, font colour, alignment elements such as text alignment, float, position and display, border style, border width and height along with margin and padding, border colour, border shape which includes border radius are used for the decoration of text in the web pages. Hover attribute is used for the links which allows them to respond to the transition effects when the mouse hovers them. </p><br>
<b>	INTERACTION OF WEB PAGES USING JAVASCRIPT</b><br>
<p>JavaScript is used for making the webpages more interactive and dynamic. When the home page is directed to the menu page, a pop-up alert message is displayed on the screen which is created using JavaScript. A confirm alert message appears when a form.is submitted. The slideshow of images in the home page is done by writing the script and navigation of page from bottom to top and to the particular section when clicked is enabled. In the register form, script is written for the confirm password input box such that the value is only accepted when the given data in the password and confirm password input box matches.
